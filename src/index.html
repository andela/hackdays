        <ul>
          <li>The solution built should at least apply one AI technology</li>
          <li>Team formation: hack in groups of between 2 - 5</li>
          <li>You can form your teams way before the hack day</li>
          <li>Building should all begin at the same time for all the teams, so
            that we all have the fun together!</li>
          <li>When the bell rings, all the tools down! Judging begins.</li>
